## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Note that this is only the back-end of the project, in order to see it working properly you'll need to install the [front-end](https://github.com/jonathasgouv/vkuserdrawer) afterwards, or make your own version of it.

It is also important to note that this back-end only provides the list of users of a given topic (and also their informations) to the front-end, all of the drawing algorithm is contained in the front-end.

## Installing
Run the following commands and you will end up with a local running version of the project.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jonathasgouv/vkuserdrawerAPI.git
$ cd vkuserdrawerAPI/
$ npm install
```

Now your server is ready to run, but first you need to put your group id on the group_id variable on the [index.js](https://github.com/jonathasgouv/vkuserdrawerAPI/blob/main/index.js) file, as below:
```
let group_id = 'GROUP ID HERE';
```
Now you just need to set you VK acess key on the .env file and that's it, you're good to go.
```
$ npm start
```
Your server is now running on [port 3000](http://localhost:3000/).
